# Physics Typer for Word

A simple tool for **fast typing of superscripts and subscripts** in Microsoft Word.  
No ribbon clicking, no breaking focus. Just type and move on.

## What problem it solves
Word is fine, but writing `x²`, `v₀`, `a₁`, or `H₂O` through the UI is slow and annoying.  
This tool automates that part.

## Features
- superscript typing
- subscript typing
- works directly in Microsoft Word
- useful for physics, math, chemistry, and technical documents

## Typical use cases
- Physics: `E = mc²`, `v₀`, `Fₙ`
- Chemistry: `H₂O`, `CO₂`
- Mathematics: `aₙ`, `xᵢ`

## How it works
The program listens for keyboard shortcuts and switches typing mode to superscript or subscript.  
From Word’s point of view, it’s the same as manual formatting — just much faster.

## Why it exists
- Word is not LaTeX  
- clicking through menus kills workflow  
- writing formulas should be quick

## Project status
- working
- simple
- focused on doing one thing well
